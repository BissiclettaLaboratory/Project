## 🙋‍♂️ About me

Hi, I’m **Ignacio**, but they call me **Bici** (because of bicycle 🚲).  
I’m **34 years old** and I live in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

I’m an inventor and, like any respectable inventor...  
**I don’t have a dime** to develop my ideas 😅.

For the last 10 years, I worked making furniture.  
Since we became world champions in 2022 🇦🇷🏆, I dedicated myself to making replicas of the Cup.  
That allowed me to earn some money and time to focus on my projects.

With that, I set up my own workshop:  
✅ I built a CNC/laser machine  
✅ I bought a lathe  
✅ Tools, cutters, measuring instruments, and more

> 🧨 But today, due to the situation in the country, sales collapsed.  
I’m writing this just before taking my PC and the last things I have to my mom’s house.  
**Fuck.**

## 💡 The project

It has **three designed versions**:

### 🔹 V1 – Basic  
Just the main system.

### 🔸 V2 – Improved  
Includes battery to work during power outages ⚡  
+ some extra features.

### 🔺 V3 – Complete  
Adds sound alarm 🔊, **Bluetooth** connection, and **cell phone notifications** 📲

🔒 For now, I don’t have the **patent**, so I can’t give more technical details.  
But I can show:

🧩 The case I printed on my (now dead) 3D printer, and  
💾 The first test PCB I made with my CNC laser.

## 🤝 Why do I need help?

I did what I could.  
I realized that, if I continue alone, this will take **years or decades**.  
That’s why I decided to ask for help from those who can **support me with a small contribution**.

With that, I could:

1. 🛡 **Patent the idea** (and its 3 versions)  
2. 🖨 **Buy a reliable 3D printer**  
3. 📐 **Finish the 3 PCB designs** and send them to be manufactured (e.g. PCBWay)  
4. 🏠 If possible, **rent a small lab** to keep working and testing

## 🚀 And then?

Once I manage to patent everything, I will **reveal** the project and show it in depth, telling you what the next steps and goals are.  
I already launched a **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BissiclettasLaboratory)** where I will show:

🧠 How to create a product **from scratch**  
🧩 Mechanical design in **SolidWorks**  
💻 Circuits and PCB in **KiCad**  
🔩 Injection molds made with CNC  
🥽 Plastic injection machines

I want to share **every step of the process** so that other inventors also get inspired.
